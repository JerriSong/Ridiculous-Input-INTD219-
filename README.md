# Ridiculous-Input-INTD219
This project makes fun of normal volume sliders by creating an intentionally annoying design. The volume ball will run away if you move it too fast, forcing you to chase and click it to continue using it. It turns a simple volume control into a frustrating game of catch, making everyday interaction deliberately difficult.
